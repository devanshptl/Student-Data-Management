# Student Data Management

Welcome to my first Django project! This project is a simple student data management application where I've implemented basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It's been a great learning experience for me as I delve into the fundamentals of the Django framework.



## Project Overview

The project focuses on managing student information with the following features:
- **Create:** Add new student records to the database.
- **Read:** Display a list of all student records and view individual student details.
- **Update:** Modify existing student information.
- **Delete:** Remove student records from the database.
- **Search:** Implement a search functionality to quickly find specific student records.

## What I've Learned

During the development of this project, I gained hands-on experience in the following areas:
- Setting up a Django project and creating a Django app.
- Defining models to represent the structure of the student data.
- Implementing views, templates, and URL patterns for different CRUD operations.
- Integrating and utilizing Django forms for data input and validation.
- Understanding the Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database interactions.
- Exploring the Django admin interface for easy data management.
## Getting Started 

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/devanshptl/django_project_1.git
   cd django_project_1

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
 python -m venv venv
```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
  * On Windows:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
```
* On macOS and Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate

```
4. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Apply migrations:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
6. Run the development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
7. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000 to access the application.

Feel free to explore the application and test out the CRUD operations.
